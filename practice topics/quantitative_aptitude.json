Let's assume A leaves and B finishes in 24 days. (2/3)/24 = 1/36. B=36. a+1/36=1/18 -> a=1/36. A=36. That doesn't match. The source answer is A, which has B=54.

Let's try to simplify. Multiply first by 2, second by 3. 16m+24b=1/5 and 18m+24b=3/14. Subtracting: 2m = 3/14 - 1/5 = (15-14)/70 = 1/70. m=1/140. One man takes 140 days. 10 men take 14 days.
